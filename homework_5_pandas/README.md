# Working with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries

The notebook `pandas.ipynb` contains a few analyses for GFF3 and BED6 file formats and visualisation of differential expression of genes.

From this notebook you may take out some functions:
* `read_gff` takes one file (or path to file) in GFF3 format and returns a pandas dataframe.
* `read_bed6` takes one file (or path to file) in BED6 format and returns a pandas dataframe.

Also there is an example of drawing volcano plot in matplotlib library.

The script `pandas.py` only a duplicate for `pandas.ipynb`. Do not run it!
